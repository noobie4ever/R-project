# Project intro
With the fast growth of population and economic scale, the need of physicians and higher education level are increasing as well. 
The county demographic information from 1990 and 1992 is the major data set that is analyzed. It provides selected data like the number 
of active physicians, total population, percent of bachelor’s degrees, per capita income, etc.

# Project goal
The aim of this project was to find out the linear regression relation among the number of active physicians and the predictors which are 
total population, the number of hospital beds, and total personal income. In the meanwhile, the project also aimed to find out the 
differences of the linear regression models about per capita income and percent of bachelor’s degrees for four different regions.

In the following analysis, the project aims to improve the prediction of the number of active physicians by adding more relevant 
predictors like population density, percent of 65 or older, etc. And figure out which predictors are helpful to the prediction which are 
hardly helpful. The analysis also compares different linear regression models and find out the intrinsic relation between predictors.
